    "* also the notification mechanism works in async fashion, which means the custom secondary index hook is responsible for inserting the updated row(s) to the Solr indexing queue, and will return to the regular Cassandra write path to finish the rest. If the Solr indexing queue gets backed up, you may experience delay for a Cassandra update to show up in Solr index even after the replica node acknowleges write being successful (hence consistency level could be met on the Cassandra side)."

So essentially it will have to be processed by Solr twice."
